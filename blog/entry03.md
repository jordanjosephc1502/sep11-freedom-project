I been using vidcode in many different ways like tutorials online , youtube video , and just making random stuff
in sandbox. I made a Fantasy Map with people in vidcode sandbox. The map has a person that you can move around
with your mouse also has 4 people that go around the map , eachtime you refresh the page it switches them around so there in different places each time. I ran into a issuse while coding this mini project.


"ISSUE"
I changed something with the code that would not let me load into the vidcode project.At first i thought it was my internet but i figured out it was something with the code. When i finally got into the project the screen was white and when i looked at the code it had a ! and a blue bar around *movie = image();* that said infinite loop detected. Now i had to try to find a fix to get my project working again. I immediately copied all the code and put it somewhere just in case i lost the project because of this loop.


"attempt #1"
i tried to remove *movie = image();* hoping the inf loop would go away but once i removed it then it said *movie.source = "map.png";* was a inf loop so i just trashed the idea


"attempt #2"
I looked more into the code and i figured it had to be somewhere with the for loop i used
*for (var i = 0; i < npcs.length; i)* i looked at other for loops i used for projects and everything looked good until i realized i was missing the ++ after the *i*. Once i placed it my code was fully working again and i got to keep coding my mini project.

"Ending"
What i learned from this is to always make sure your for loop is correct or it could mess up your whole code. I also remember when Mr. Muller was explaining for loops this could happen and he said that without the i without the ++ the code the increments keep running and theres no stop to the loop.

"What i Plan on learning next"
Im going to look more into the vidcode channel and documents they have explaining stuff and see what else they have to offer that i can learn or stuff that they have to offer that other platforms dont have to offer. Im also hoping that vidcode improves my javascript knowledge.
